## Description
This homework proposes a novel computational intelligence architecture, which combines DeepRL, GNNs, and Attention Networks to effectively solve the MDTSP. It also uses a fuzzy genetic algorithm that does the optimal depot selection using the pre-trained model.

## Features
List the key features of your project. For example:
- GNN and Attention Mechanisms: Creation of node, graph and agent embeddings leading to a stochastic assignment mechanism
- Deep Reinforcement Learning: Uses these embeddings to learn a strong policy and find a very good solution for the MDTSP.
- Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic: Finds the best depot for each agent using the RL model. The fuzzy logic is integrated into the mutation rate and enhances the performance of the algorithm.

## Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to get the development environment running.
